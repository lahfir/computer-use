# Development Practices

## Accuracy and Documentation

- **DO NOT HALLUCINATE** - Only implement what is explicitly requested
- Always refer to official documentation for implementation details
- Verify all assumptions against source documentation
- When implementing APIs or libraries, check the official docs first

## Code Implementation

- Only code what's necessary - avoid over-engineering
- Implement features incrementally and test each step
- Focus on the core functionality first, then add enhancements
- Avoid premature optimization

## Documentation Requirements

- Before implementing any feature, consult the relevant documentation
- Use official examples and patterns from documentation
- If documentation is unclear, ask for clarification rather than assuming
- Reference specific documentation sections when implementing features

## Testing and Validation

- Test implementations against documented behavior
- Validate that code works as documented
- Ensure error handling follows documented patterns
- Verify edge cases are handled according to documentation

## Python Type Hints and Data Validation

- **ALWAYS use Python type hints** (annotations) for all functions, methods, and variables
- Add type hints to function parameters and return values: `def func(name: str, age: int) -> dict[str, Any]:`
- Never use `Any` from `typing` unless absolutely necessary and well-justified
- Use Pydantic models (BaseModel) for data validation and serialization
- Define Pydantic models for complex data structures and API schemas
- Leverage Pydantic's runtime validation for input/output data
- Import from `typing` for type annotations: `Union`, `Optional`, `list`, `dict`, `Literal`, etc.
- Ensure all Pydantic models have proper field type annotations and validation rules
- Use Pydantic's `Field` for additional validation constraints and metadata
- Always validate external data (user input, API responses, file contents) with Pydantic models
- Use ruff to check type hints and catch type-related issues
